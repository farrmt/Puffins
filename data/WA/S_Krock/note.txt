Attached is an Excel copy of seabird records from our “Seabird Catalog.” I have excluded 483 Black Oystercatcher 
records due to the concerns Scott stated below. The most recent entries are from 2017, unfortunately more recent data 
from USFWS or other sources has not yet been received/incorporated. I have also attached a copy of the metadata 
definitions which might be helpful in deciphering the data. Please let Scott or myself know if you have any questions.
