Attached are some csv files for TUPU data (I filtered the full marbled murrelet dataset to just include records 
with no sightings and records with TUPU sightings because the full dataset is huge and is a mess with different 
column names through different years and random spaces after species names for some records...I figured it would 
be stupid to send you all the messy data when I already wrote code to clean it up).  However, if you want the raw 
data, I think I can get you access to those data on the Google Drive - just let me know.

I have a file for Zone 1 (Salish Sea), which also includes the lengths of each nearshore segment, but it might 
not actually be useful to you because there are only 24 TUPU records over the 20 years of data.  For the coastal 
surveys (Zone 2), I have two files because the dataset for 2013 is missing a ton of info.  Therefore, I have a 
file that includes all years of Zone 2 (2011-2021 but no data were collected for 2016, 2018, or 2020 - surveys 
switched to every other year), and I have another file that has all of those years plus 2013.  Finally, I have 
a file for the pelagic data.  I don't have any of the lengths of the segments calculated for the Zone 2 or pelagic 
data but will probably get around to doing so eventually for the humpy data, which come from the same dataset, 
and I can share those with you once that is completed.
