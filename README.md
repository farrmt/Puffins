This repo is to summarize the work by L Petracca of the University of
Washington’s Quantitative Conservation Lab through December 2022 on the
TUPU project, with project partners B. Gardner, P. Hodum, R. Kaler, S.
Pearson, H. Renner, & S.J. Converse.

The git repo should be fairly straightforward. All colony datasets and
colony visualization figures are in “data”, monitoring documents are in
“documents”, scripts for data processing and circular plot burrow
sampling are in “scripts”, a SAFS Quantitative Seminar presentation from
November 18 2022 is in “presentations”, and summary figures are in
“results”. A note that older scripts and figures are in
scripts/legacy_scripts and data/a_figures/legacy_figures, respectively.
