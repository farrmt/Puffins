This repo is to summarize the work by L Petracca of the University of Washington's Quantitative Conservation Lab through December 2022 on the TUPU project, with project partners B. Gardner, P. Hodum, R. Kaler, S. Pearson, H. Renner, & S.J. Converse.

The git repo should be fairly straightforward. All colony datasets and colony visualization figures are in "data", monitoring documents are in "documents", scripts for data processing and circular plot burrow sampling are in "scripts", a SAFS Quantitative Seminar presentation from November 18 2022 is in "presentations", and summary figures are in "results". A note that older scripts and figures are in scripts/legacy_scripts and data/a_figures/legacy_figures, respectively.
